# Clean-StreetView
A google chrome extension that removes as much of the on screen navigation and other stuff as it can so you can take 'clean' screen shots. 

The orginal was inspired by Karl Hodges Medium post [Take better Google Street View screenshots](https://medium.com/@karlhodge/take-better-google-street-view-screenshots-e8b025861756)

As Karl notes, screen grabs of Google Street view are used by journalists to illustrate stories when your "editor wants you to publish fifty-eight pieces of content every day and won’t let you leave your desk". But the results often look messy when they include the navigation and other user interface elements that StreetView plasters over the content. 

The original extension takes the user interface CSS that Karl identifies and turns it off with a cick of the icon. This updated version for 2026,  It does a lot of the same thing but it also does some pretty brute force hiding, covering and re-ordering to work! Hopefully behind the scenes! 

## Making it work.
1. Download the [cleanstreetview.zip](cleanstreetview.zip) file from here. 
2. Unzip it somewhere on your computer.
3. In Google Chrome visit chrome://extensions
4. Drag and drop the unzipped folder on to the page. A new icon should appear in the tool bar. You can also upload manually. If you go to chrome://extensions and then look for the **Load Unpacked button**. Click that, navigate to the unziped folder and then click **Select**
5. Navigate to google maps and choose a location in street view. Karl has some good tips for setting up the right 'shot' in his post. 
6. Once you're happy, click the Clean StreetView icon and the UI should dissapear. 
7. Go full screen or take your screen shot in the usual way

If you want to get the navigation back, just refresh the page.
